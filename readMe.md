#Intermediate Java String Project

This project is an intermediate level program. It is a Java-based library that provides various functionalities to manipulate and analyze strings. Features include case reversal, character count, string reversal, breaking down a string into separate lines per word, word count, character count excluding spaces, average word length calculation, vowel count, substring count, and palindrome detection

**Expected Output:** 
```

Current string: This land is your land. 
Current String with reversed case: tHIS LAND IS YOUR LAND. 
Times 'a' appears in the string: 2 
String reversed: .dnal ruoy si dnal sihT 
Each word on a separate line:  
This 
land 
is 
your 
land. 
Number of words in the String: 5 
Number of characters in the String: 19 
Average word length in the String: 3.8 
Number of vowels in the String: 6 
Number of times that the substring 's' occurs in the String: 2 
Your string: This land is your land.  
Is it a Palindrome?: false 

New string: Yo! Banana boy!. 
Your new string: Yo! Banana boy!  
Is it a Palindrome?: true
```

**Now test the program using other values:**

stats: Strings are better than Robots -- maybe.
stats2: toyboat

stats: help me
stats2: racecar

stats: Thanks for using the StringTester class.
stats2: Was it a car or a cat I saw?
